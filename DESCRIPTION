Description: The graphical approach is proposed as a general framework for clinical trial designs involving multiple hypotheses, where decisions are made only based on the observed marginal p-values. A reverse graphical approach starts from a set of singleton graphs, and gradually add vertices into graphs until rejection of a set of hypotheses is made. See Gou, J. (2020). Reverse graphical approaches for multiple test procedures. Technical Report.
